### Description
In this course, instructor Brett McLaughlin showed me how React and a complete web development ecosystem work together in building applications. Brett went through all the steps in getting my React app set up, deployed, connected, and supported. Next, he steped me through creating React components to organize and display your content. 

Brett taught me how to add cloud services like a database using JSON data and encouraged me to ensure my code works on the cloud platform I'm targeting. He covers how to interact with AWS and DynamoDB through the command line, then how to create and use a DynamoDB table. 

Next, Brett went into how to create, load, and test a new role that can execute Lambda functions and interact with DynamoDB. He walked me through creating and deploying an API gateway. Brett concludes by showing me how to connect my React code to an API Gateway endpoint.
